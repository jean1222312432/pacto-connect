# Pacto Connect

**Embeddable SDK + widget to add [Pacto P2P](https://github.com/PACTO-LAT/pacto-p2p) stablecoin buy/sell flows to any site** — Stripe Checkout–style.

Drop-in components let any dApp or merchant offer "Buy/Sell USDC with Pacto" over regional payment rails, secured by Trustless Work escrows on Stellar — without integrating the full Pacto platform.

## Architecture

```
pacto-connect/
├── packages/
│   ├── connect-core/      # Framework-agnostic SDK (handshake, REST client, escrow events)
│   ├── connect-react/     # <PactoCheckout/> + hooks
│   └── connect-elements/  # <pacto-checkout> web-component for non-React sites
├── services/
│   └── connect-gateway/   # BFF: issues pk_/sk_ keys, signs handshakes, proxies Pacto API, webhooks
└── apps/
    └── docs/              # Docs site + interactive playground
```

The **Connect Gateway** is the only component that talks to the Pacto P2P API. The integrator's SDK only ever holds a `publishableKey`, so the main platform's credentials are never exposed and the main repo is never modified.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run build      # build all packages
npm run dev        # watch mode across packages + gateway
npm run check      # Biome lint + format check
npm run type-check
```
